Dear JavaScript,

JavaScript changed the way we develop web applications and influenced many developers and projects.

We want to thank [Brendan Eich](@BrendanEich), JavaScript core developers, contributors, and all the people involved in making the JavaScript language and its ecosystem a better place for everyone.

Thank you so much for all that you have done and do.

Signed,
